## Overview
Spacewalks is a Python analysis tool for researchers to generate visualisations 
and statistical summaries of NASA's extravehicular activity datasets.

## Features
Key features of Spacewalks:

- Generates a CSV table of summary statistics of extravehicular activity crew sizes.
- Generates a line plot to show the cumulative duration of space walks over time

## Pre-requisites

Spacewalkes was developed using Python version 3.12.

To install and run Spacewalks you will need to have Python >=3.12.
